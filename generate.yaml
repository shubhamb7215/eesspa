description: "# OverviewEcoStruxure? Energy and Sustainability Scoring Partner API\
  \ allows Building Performance Score Providers to collect, manage and benchmark buildings\
  \ measurement data in order to deliver energy and sustainability performance scores\
  \ to Schneider Electric customers registered with scoring partner application.##\
  \ API overview and usageThis API enables the following features:**Sites Metadata**-\
  \ Retrieve all sites belonging to which the connected user has access, along site\
  \ metadata needed for performance scores calculation (e.g. gross area, building\
  \ occupants, operating hours, etc)**Meters and Measurement Types**- Retrieve all\
  \ meters installed at a given site, including the list of measurements and units\
  \ they support**Sites Registration**- Allow the Scoring Partner, to register a site\
  \ providing the scores related details and thus starting automatically a data pipeline\
  \ to collect all timeseries related information**Timeseries**- Retrieve all timeseries\
  \ for any given site and for an arbitrary time period- Room comfort data: zone temperature,\
  \ humidity, CO2- Waste Management: waste diverted and waste generated- Energy consumption:\
  \ electricity and fuel consumption**Performance Scores*** Provide Performance Scores\
  \ for a given site and read current and historical scores* Supported Types: Daily,\
  \ Monthly, Average, Local Average * Supported Categories: Electricity, Fuel, Water,\

  \ Schneider Electric customer who has an identity in Schneider Electric system,\
  \ and site data associated with its identity.The following steps will explain how\
  \ the API works,**Step 1:** In order to access the customer data, the customer must\
  \ identify themself and provide their consent to the scoring application.**Step\
  \ 2:** Enquire all the sites which the customer is authorized to calculate the performance\
  \ scores.**Step 3:** Enquire meters and timeseries measurements for a selected site.**Step\
  \ 4:** Calculate the scores based on the building measurement data received from\
  \ Schneider Electric.**Step 5:** Update the performance scores calculated for the\
  \ given site back to Schneider Electric. ![How it works](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecostruxure-openapi/public-images/main/energy-sustainability-scoring/how-it-works-new.png\
  \ \"How it works\")# Documentation    ## How to sign up    **Step 1:** [Register\
  \ or login](https://exchange.se.com) with an Exchange account.**Step 2:** Subscribe\
  \ to the [API product in our Shop](https://exchange.se.com).**Step 3:** After subscription,\
  \ API credentials and usage details for the API are available in developer portal.##\
  \ Authentication guideThis API supports the following authentication mechanism:**OAuth2\
  \ Authorization Code Flow**   Once subscription to the API is approved on [Exchange](https://exchange.se.com),\
  \ API Subscription Client ID and Client Secret will be shared with the subscriber\
  \   The Client ID should be sent when calling the Authorize Endpoint to initiate\
  \ the Authorization and Consent flow.    Once user consents to the scopes requested\
  \ by the client app, an authorization code will be issued which needs to be sent\
  \ to the Token Endpoint with grant_type as *authorization_code*, along with Client\
  \ ID and Client Secret in order to retrieve an access_token and a refresh_token.\
  \ In order to retrieve a new access_token, call the Token endpoint with grant_type\
  \ as *refresh_token* and pass the refresh_token issued before.    Each access_token\
  \ is valid for 1 hour and has to be provided to every API call as HTTP Request Header\
  \ `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}` ![Authorization Code Flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecostruxure-openapi/public-images/main/energy-sustainability-scoring/authorization_flow.png\
  \ \"Authorization Code Flow diagram\")## Sandbox Testing**What is Sandbox Test Data?**Sandbox\
  \ test data refers to simulated data that can be used for testing or validating\
  \ an API without manipulating real production data. It provides a safe environment\
  \ for developers to experiment with the API, test different scenarios and identify\
  \ errors before deploying it to the production server.**Why is Sandbox Test Data\
  \ Important?**Working with live production data can be risky, especially during\
  \ development and testing phases where unexpected changes can occur. Sandbox test\
  \ data allows developers to create an isolated environment where they can test new\
  \ features, fix bugs, and improve overall performance without causing any harm to\
  \ the production data. This helps save time, money and minimizes the risk of introducing\
  \ new issues into the production system.Get access token for sandbox testing using\
  \ sandbox authorize endpoint mentioned below  > Sandbox authorize endpoint: https://se-exchange-uat-uat.apigee.net/ecostruxure/v1/oauth/sandbox-authorize##\
